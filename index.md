Hello! My name is Kristian Lewis Jones

I'm a web developer with four years of freelance experieance and several qualifications.

I've always been motivated to learn how things work. However I've specialised in both front-end and back-end web development. Only recently I've started to increase my skill in front-end development by using JavascriptMVC.

I also like...

- Gaming _\[PC\]_
- Motocross
- Learning new things
- Helping others learn _\[Friends; IRC\]_
